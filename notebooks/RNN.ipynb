    "For each song, we will focus only on the chorus. The idea behind this is both in term of performance and in term of computations. In terms of performance, the chorus contains the whole message of the song in just a few lines and also it will be the most powerful, highest energy, loudest, catchiest, and most memorable part of any song. Thus, it make sense that most tiktokers will choose this part for their video. In addition, in term of computation, working on shorter audio file (only the chorus compared to the whole song) / smaller spectogram will require less computations.\n",
