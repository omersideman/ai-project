The following are the python libraries we used in our project: (pip install them)

    scikit-learn
    mypy
    tqdm            # progress bar
    ipykernel
    spotipy         # spotify features
    python-dotenv
    pandas          # dataframes
    types-requests 
    matplotlib      # plottings
    ipywidgets 
    seaborn         # heatmaps
    torch           # most of the NN work
    torchaudio      # working with audio files
    torchmetrics    # Confusion Matrix
    kornia          # Focal Loss
    numpy           # tensors type to work with the simple classifiers, except MLP
    librosa         # working with audio files
    flask
    requests        # http requests
    pytube          # for downloading the songs
    scikit-image    # many simple models (not deep models) and other algorithms in the learning field
    pychorus        # finding the chorus of song
    ffmpeg-python   # python interface for ffmpeg

We also need to install ffmpeg library manually. ffmpeg is used for processing of audio files (specifically to find the length of MP3 files).
