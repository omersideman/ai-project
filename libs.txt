The following are the python libraries we used in our project: (pip install them)

    scikit-learn
    mypy
    tqdm            # progress bar
    ipykernel
    spotipy         # spotify features
    python-dotenv
    pandas          # dataframes
    types-requests 
    matplotlib      # plottings
    ipywidgets 
    seaborn         # heatmaps
    torch           # most of the NN work
    torchaudio      # working with audio files
    torchmetrics    # Confusion Matrix
    kornia          # Focal Loss
    numpy           # tensors type to work with the simple classifiers, except MLP
    librosa         # working with audio files
    flask
    requests        # http requests
    pytube          # for downloading the songs
    scikit-image    # many simple models (not deep models) and other algorithms in the learning field
    pychorus        # finding the chorus of song
    ffmpeg-python   # python interface for ffmpeg

We also need to install ffmpeg library manually. ffmpeg is used for processing of audio files and we will use it in order to convert the audio file to a type torchaudio can work with.
